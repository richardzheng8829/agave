## What is Aave?

Aave is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an over-collateralised (perpetually) or under-collateralised (one-block liquidity) fashion.

The following documentation describes the fundamentals of the protocol and how to interact with it. Please join the #development room in the [Aave community Discord server](https://discord.gg/fVaDMqT); our team and members of the community look forward to helping you build on top of Aave.

The protocol is implemented as a set of **smart contracts** on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts guarantee safety and do not require a middleman.&#x20;
